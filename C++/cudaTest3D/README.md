# My introduction to Cuda

Some time ago, I developed a "3D" engine using python. I was getting into linear algebra and wanted to test my skills using matrices. This is technically not true 3D. It works by determining brightness of pixel based on z value than "rotates" by moving said pixel. I then wrote it in C for faster framerate (from 4fps to ~70). Finally I began looking into using my GPU and stumbled across cuda. Feeling relatively comfortable with C, I decided to give it a go.

# test-repo

Where I store all my tests with a given language or technology. I am putting no effort into organization of the repo; which language it's written in is enough for me.
Not all folder have README, just the ones I feel are significant enough to deserve one.

Keep in mind this repo does have examples of code that aren't mine.

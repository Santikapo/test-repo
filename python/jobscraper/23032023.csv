"Senior Technical Program Manager, Availability",Block,"Vancouver, BC",, ,"
 Company Description
  Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.
  Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.
  There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.
 
 

 Job Description
  We’re hiring for a Senior Technical Program Manager - Reliability for the Reliability and Incident Management TPM team in Foundational Engineering.

You will help to report on organizational-level reliability and disaster recovery trends. You will deliver projects that build resilience into Square’s critical business systems and ensure service and data availability for our sellers. You will use your program leadership skills and technical expertise in DevOps (site reliability, disaster recovery and tooling automation) to deliver successful project outcomes.
  Note this role will report into our TPM Lead for Reliability and Incident Management and partner closely with our Cloud Platform Engineering organization within Foundational Engineering.
  What You Will Be Doing:
 
   Create Square-wide Disaster Recovery metrics and guide adoption of Disaster Recovery program
   Lead planning, execution and monitoring of large scale initiatives related to Site Reliability and Disaster Recovery and coordinate cross-functional dependencies
   Work with teams to clarify objectives, KPIs and success criteria and communicate blockers, risks and outcomes to management
   Take a data-driven approach to program management, building tools and leveraging data to drive stakeholder buy-in
 
 
 

 Qualifications
  Must have:
 
   Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or Computer Information Systems and/or equivalent work experience in related technical field
   5+ years of technical program management experience in agile software development environment with a proven track record leading large, complex technology projects and managing risks
   Fluency in Agile project management methodologies (such as Kanban, Scrum, or SAFe); having an active project management certification (PMP, CSM, etc) is a strong plus
   Solid understanding of SDLC and familiarity with software architecture and design
   Firm grasp of traditional SRE and DevOps concepts
   Prior experience with a public cloud such as AWS, GCP, etc.
   Experience with data manipulation and analysis
   Excellent written and verbal communication skills
   Strong collaboration skills; comfortable working with leadership and explaining technical subject matter to non-technical business partners
